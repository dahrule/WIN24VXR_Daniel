/// This is a new Enemy Type that you will create. Inherit from EnemyHitTarget instead of MonoBehaviour and override the Attack, 
/// Move, and/or Destroy methods to fit your design behavior. 
/// Utilize methods and attributes that are already available in the parent class to avoid code repetition and add new ones if needed to fit your design.
/// Remember that to override a method in a child class, in the parent class, it has to contain the modifier public or protected, as well as the modifier virtual. 
/// Similarly, in the child class, it must also contain the modifier protected or public, but instead of virtual, it must contain the modifier override.
